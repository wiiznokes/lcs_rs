Longest common subsequence implementation in rust.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence


bench for the 10000-10000 test (the 15000 one doesn't work):

##### Rust
Time: 651.823209ms


##### Java
Time: 623.69858 millis


This result varies += 50 ms on my pc.

None of both implementations have been hardly optimized, but the algorithm used is quit fast.
